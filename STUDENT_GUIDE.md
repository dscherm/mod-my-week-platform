## Challenge Categories

### 🔐 Cryptography
Learn about secret codes, encryption, and protecting data!

**Topics:**
- Caesar Cipher (ancient Roman secret codes)
- Base64 encoding
- Hexadecimal conversion
- ROT13 cipher
- Hash functions

**Why it matters:** Cryptography protects your messages, passwords, and online shopping. Every HTTPS website uses it!

### 🌐 Network Security
Understand how computers communicate and stay safe online.

**Topics:**
- Network ports (like doors on your computer)
- IP addresses (like street addresses for computers)
- Protocols (rules for communication)
- Firewalls (security guards for networks)

**Why it matters:** Networks connect everything. Understanding them helps you stay safe and build secure systems.

### 🔑 Password Security
Master the art of creating and protecting passwords.

**Topics:**
- Password strength
- Brute force attacks
- Common password mistakes
- Password hashing (how sites store passwords safely)

**Why it matters:** Passwords protect your accounts. Weak passwords are the #1 reason people get hacked!

### 🌍 Web Security
Learn how websites can be vulnerable and how to protect them.

**Topics:**
- Phishing URLs (fake websites)
- SQL injection (attacking databases)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- HTTP vs HTTPS (secure vs insecure websites)

**Why it matters:** You use websites every day. Understanding web security keeps you and your data safe.

### 🎭 Social Engineering
Recognize psychological tricks hackers use to manipulate people.

**Topics:**
- Phishing emails (fake messages)
- Pretexting (fake identities)
- Tailgating (sneaking into buildings)
- USB baiting (malicious USB drives)

**Why it matters:** Most security breaches start with tricking people, not breaking computers. You are the strongest defense!
