**Core Content:**
[Present the main concepts with visuals, examples, and clear explanations]

```javascript
// Code example with comments
let example = [1, 2, 3];  // Explain what this does
```

**Key Points:**
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Point 1 | Explanation |
| Point 2 | Explanation |

### Part 2: [Next Concept]

[Continue with structured content delivery]

### Visual Summary

```
[Create ASCII diagram or visual representation]

Example array visualization:
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  0  │  1  │  2  │  3  │  4  │  ← indices
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│"red"│"blu"│"grn"│"ylw"│"prp"│  ← values
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

### Memory Device
> "[Mnemonic or memorable phrase]"

---

## Phase 3: APPLY (15-20 minutes)

### Guided Practice: "[Activity Name]"

**Instructions:**
1. [Step-by-step guided activity]
2. [Teacher models first if needed]
3. [Students practice with support]

**Task 1: [Specific Task]**
[Description of task with scaffolding]

**Task 2: [Platform Exercise]**
Have students complete exercise [ID] on the platform.
- Walk through the starter code together
- Point out key sections
- Let students work with support

**Answer Key:**
```javascript
// Solution code
```

---

## Phase 4: PRACTICE (15-20 minutes)

### Independent Challenge: "[Challenge Name]"

**Exercise 1: [Name]** (Platform: [exercise-id])
Students complete independently or with partner.

**Exercise 2: [Name]** (Platform: [exercise-id])
More challenging application.

**Goal:** Complete at least [X] exercises earning [Y] points.

**Extension Challenge:**
[For students who finish early]

---

## Phase 5: CHALLENGE (10-15 minutes)

### Mini-Challenge: "[Theme Name]"

**Scenario:**
> "[Engaging scenario that frames the challenge]"

**Level 1 (Basic):**
[Basic application - all students should achieve]

**Level 2 (Intermediate):**
[Intermediate application]

**Level 3 (Advanced):**
[Advanced application for fast finishers]

**BONUS:**
[Extension for highly advanced students]

---

## Wrap-Up & Reflection (5 minutes)

### Key Takeaways
1. [Main point 1]
2. [Main point 2]
3. [Main point 3]

### Exit Ticket
> "[Question from the exercises.js exitTicket field]"

### Preview Next Lesson
> "[Teaser for next lesson that creates anticipation]"

---

## Differentiation

### For Struggling Students
- Provide additional starter code
- Pair with successful student
- Focus on first exercise only
- Allow reference to completed examples
- Offer verbal explanation instead of written

### For Advanced Students
- Skip guided practice, move to independent
- Add constraints (fewer lines, no hints)
- Design custom variation
- Help peers as "expert consultant"
- Research related p5.js functions
