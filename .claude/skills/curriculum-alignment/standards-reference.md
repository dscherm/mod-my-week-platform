## Major Standards Frameworks

### CSTA (Computer Science Teachers Association)

**Grade Bands:**
- 1A (K-2), 1B (3-5), 2 (6-8), 3A (9-10), 3B (11-12)

**Concept Areas:**
1. Computing Systems
2. Networks & Internet
3. Data & Analysis
4. Algorithms & Programming
5. Impacts of Computing

**Example Standards:**
```
2-AP-10: Use flowcharts and/or pseudocode to address complex problems
2-AP-12: Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control
         structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals
2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes
3A-AP-13: Create prototypes that use algorithms to solve computational
          problems by leveraging prior student knowledge
```

### ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education)

**Student Standards:**
1. Empowered Learner
2. Digital Citizen
3. Knowledge Constructor
4. Innovative Designer
5. Computational Thinker
6. Creative Communicator
7. Global Collaborator

**Example Standards:**
```
5a: Students formulate problem definitions suited for technology-assisted
    methods such as data analysis, abstract models and algorithmic thinking
5c: Students break problems into component parts, extract key information,
    and develop descriptive models to understand complex systems
```

### Common Core (Math - Standards for Mathematical Practice)

```
MP1: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them
MP2: Reason abstractly and quantitatively
MP4: Model with mathematics
MP5: Use appropriate tools strategically
MP6: Attend to precision
MP7: Look for and make use of structure
MP8: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning
```

### NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards)

**Science & Engineering Practices:**
1. Asking Questions
2. Developing and Using Models
3. Planning and Carrying Out Investigations
4. Analyzing and Interpreting Data
5. Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
6. Constructing Explanations
7. Engaging in Argument from Evidence
8. Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information
