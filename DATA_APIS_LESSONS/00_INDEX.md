## Using These Lessons

### Lesson Template
All lessons follow the 5E instructional model:
1. **EXPLORE** (10-15 min) - Spark curiosity, surface prior knowledge
2. **EXPLAIN** (15-20 min) - Direct instruction, core concepts
3. **APPLY** (15-20 min) - Guided practice with platform exercises
4. **PRACTICE** (15-20 min) - Independent work on exercises
5. **CHALLENGE** (10-15 min) - Extension for fast finishers

### Platform Integration

- Points are tracked in the platform's progress system
- Exercises include starter code, hints, and solution code

### Materials Checklist
Every lesson requires:
- [ ] CyberEd Range platform access
- [ ] Modern browser with DevTools
- [ ] Internet connection (for API calls)
- [ ] Projector/screen for demonstrations
